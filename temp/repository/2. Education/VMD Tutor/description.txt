<b>VMDTutor<b> enables the analysis of scientific knowledge in an interactive way, using VMD. At the current stage, <b>VMDTutor<b> it is used to explore the structure of proteins, namely the primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures.  Each of these subjects are contextualised and explain in different sections of the plug-in and illustrated in three dimensions in the immersive display of VMD. The user can interact with these structures and visualise them in different ways that are pre-programmed in the plug-in. We believe that this new interactive way to export protein structures using VMD can be of great help for students and researchers in the biochemical  and related research areas.
